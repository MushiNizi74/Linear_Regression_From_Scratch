# Linear_Regression_From_Scratch
This is a practice file inspired by Venelin Valkov and his repository of Machine Learning from Scratch. This is my own take on how to get the same result with a different way. This is purely for practice and revision purposes and all credits go to Venelin Valkov for such a inspiring repository!
